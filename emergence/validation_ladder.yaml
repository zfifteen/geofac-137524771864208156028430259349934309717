# Validation Ladder for Cell-View Factor Morphospace
# UNBALANCED semiprimes (ratio ~1:3) with base seed 42
# Per-gate seed = base_seed + bit_size
#
# Unbalanced means p << q, placing the small factor well below √N.
# This makes the search non-trivial (can't just look at √N).

base_seed: 42
ratio: 0.25  # small factor gets ~25% of the bits (1:3 ratio)

# Algotypes for dual-heuristic experiments (Levin-inspired)
algotypes:
  - name: bubble
    description: "Hyper-local (adjacent swaps only), high DG tendency, robust to defects"
  - name: selection  
    description: "Semi-global (scans for min/max), greedy, more brittle with defects"
